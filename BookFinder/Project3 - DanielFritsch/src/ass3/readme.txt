This is my submission for project 3(implementing a hash map)

I worked alone on this project so the submission is mine alone. 
my email is djf122@pitt.edu



Notes:

This program was built in Eclipse. I thought that might be important to note.

I was not able to pass the last of the MyHashMapTest.java tests,
that being the testresize one which I could not figure out what the
problem was. I tried several things to try to fix it but was not able to.
All of the other tests from MyHashMapTest work when I run the java file.
->
I kept working after this and the efficacy of the program should not be affected 
because it runs according to the instructions in the google doc that we received.
The program is implemented according to the directions received despite not being
able to pass this one test. 
 
-In addition all the tests in BookFinderTest work in my own verificications. 

I submitted this submission in a zip file without the GoodReadsData.txt as instructed.
I submitted the files under the ass3 package includnig the readme file which I placed 
in that package. I hope this is okay for the submission.
